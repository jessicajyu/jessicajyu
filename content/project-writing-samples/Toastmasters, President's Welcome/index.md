When I first began Toastmasters, I was looking for a place to develop my voice. Ever since I was young, I wanted to be able to connect with others, help resolve conflicts, and sing with all my might. However, I often found my voice too small and my sentences unclear. When people could not hear me or interrupted me, I felt a clench in my throat that made my voice even smaller.  

At the start of my master’s studies in 2019, I decided it was time to get social. I was a great student in undergrad and likeable enough, but I wanted to deepen my relationships and push myself out of my comfort zone. I knew I had some social quirks (e.g., a tendency to abruptly exit conversations when my mind was thinking about the ‘next thing to do’). I tended to shy away from team sports because I found the responsibility overwhelming. I also wasn’t a particularly nimble conversationalist and would often let conversations drift to comfortable (for me) silence when I was tired of speaking. 

With these observations in mind, I decided to join Dragon Boating, the UofG Improv Club, and Toastmasters. At Town and Gown Toastmasters, I found a space full of inspired speakers and even better listeners. The Toastmasters curriculum teaches technical skills such as effective vocal variety, body language, and speech structure. However, my favourite part is the Effective Evaluation Project where you learn not only how to give an evaluation that motivates and encourages, but also how to receive feedback and learn from it. 

Now, I am a Language Assistant for secondary students in Quebec. In this position, I deliver workshops and activities that encourage the students to speak English. But also broaden their perspectives on their role in this world. Toastmasters helped me to develop the speaking skills, confidence, and flexibility required when working with students. And each day, I consider the things that went well and the things that could be improved to create a better experience for the students tomorrow. My personal goal is to ensure that every student feels heard and develops confidence in the power of their own voices.

Regardless of your personal goals, Town and Gown Toastmasters offers a warm environment with tons of opportunities to help you warm up your voice. Welcome to Town and Gown Toastmasters. I look forward to learning with you.

Sincerely,



Jessica Yu
2021-22 Town and Gown Toastmasters President
