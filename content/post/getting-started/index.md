## Welcome to my online garden

After years of losing journals, I finally created this space to record and share memories of my baby steps towards improved friendships, familyships, romanticships, workships, and of course selfship. I believe that unhappiness comes from a mismatch in values and actions. Conversely, I feel most peaceful when I am living life on my own terms. If it gives you any insight into my wiring, my favourite quote is "relationships move at the speed of vulnerability". This is one motto that I try and sometimes fail to live by. My writing comes from the perspective of a Toronto-raised, Guelph-educated-teacher & nutritionist, currently working in a little Quebec town of 2000. For me, "fun" is defined as little challenges: smiling at people on the street, public speaking, social dancing; only wearing used clothing, -30ËšC hikes, yoga in the mornings; super efficient & delicious meal prepping, sewing a meditation cushion, coding this blog on R. Feel free to take a look around and I hope you have a great day!
